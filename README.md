## Hi everyone! ƒ∞ am Ic3zy
### The codes you see are textmaker codes prepared using web automation. Licensed from MIT
### It requires chromedriver and geckodriver to work (both are available in the file).
## ƒ∞nstalling Codes :
```py
$ git clone https://github.com/abdullah5151/textmakeras
$ cd textmakeras
$ pip install selenium
$ pip install pillow
$ pip install requests
$ pip install .
# Now "." We are using it, the project is in the testing phase and will be uploaded to PYPI in the future.
```
## Example Code :
```py
from textmaker import wttp
chrome_driver_path="C\\chromedriver\\chromedriver.exe"
wttp(chrome_driver_path,"Hello World!","C:\\Users\\abdullah\\Desktop")
# In the 3rd section, we enter the address to be registered. There should be an asset folder where we enter.
# In the 2rd section, your texts.
```
```py
from textmaker import text2fire
# For more combinations, you can look at the init file in textmaker. "You can use all the commands in the .index import section."
# To use "text" we will enter the address "geckodriver"
gecko_driver_path="C:\\geckodriver\\geckodriver.exe"
text2fire(gecko_driver_path, "Hello Everyone!", "C:\\Users\\abdullah\\Desktop")
# In the 3rd section, we enter the address to be registered. There should be an asset folder where we enter.
# In the 2rd section, your texts.
# We use chromedriver for ttp commands. geckodriver for text commands
```
## Time to use Attp. Attp is a gif maker. You can design the color codes according to your own. The part where attp is: textmaker\\baseler\\gifbase.py :
```py
from textmaker import attp
attp("Hello Friends!", "C:\\Users\\abdullah\\Desktop")
# In the 2rd section, we enter the address to be registered. There should be an asset folder where we enter.
# In the 1rd section, your texts.
# No need to use driver
```
## It's time to add automation from Textpro.me. First of all, we find a suitable text-image infrastructure for ourselves. We copy the link. If there is 1 text entry in the infrastructure we found, the codes we will write will look like this. :
```py
from texmaker import textbase
gecko_driver_path="C:\\geckodriver\\geckodriver.exe"
def example(text,savepath)
    savepath=f"{savepath}\\assets" # assets = your saved folder name.
    textbase(gecko_driver_path,"The link you got from the textpro.me site"text,savepath)
# In the 1rd, we enter the link we received from the textpro.me website. Example https://textpro.me/create-berry-text-effect-online-free-1033.html
# Example usage
example("TURKEY", "C:\\Users\\abdullah\\Desktop")
# In the 2rd section, we enter the address to be registered. There should be an asset folder where we enter.
# In the 1rd section, your texts.
```
